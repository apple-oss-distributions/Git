	 * Some explanation of info->versions and info->offsets...
	 *
	 * process_entries() iterates over all relevant files AND
	 * directories in reverse lexicographic order, and calls this
	 * function.  Thus, an example of the paths that process_entries()
	 * could operate on (along with the directories for those paths
	 * being shown) is:
	 *
	 *     xtract.c             ""
	 *     tokens.txt           ""
	 *     src/moduleB/umm.c    src/moduleB
	 *     src/moduleB/stuff.h  src/moduleB
	 *     src/moduleB/baz.c    src/moduleB
	 *     src/moduleB          src
	 *     src/moduleA/foo.c    src/moduleA
	 *     src/moduleA/bar.c    src/moduleA
	 *     src/moduleA          src
	 *     src                  ""
	 *     Makefile             ""
	 *
	 * info->versions:
	 *
	 *     always contains the unprocessed entries and their
	 *     version_info information.  For example, after the first five
	 *     entries above, info->versions would be:
	 *
	 *     	   xtract.c     <xtract.c's version_info>
	 *     	   token.txt    <token.txt's version_info>
	 *     	   umm.c        <src/moduleB/umm.c's version_info>
	 *     	   stuff.h      <src/moduleB/stuff.h's version_info>
	 *     	   baz.c        <src/moduleB/baz.c's version_info>
	 *
	 *     Once a subdirectory is completed we remove the entries in
	 *     that subdirectory from info->versions, writing it as a tree
	 *     (write_tree()).  Thus, as soon as we get to src/moduleB,
	 *     info->versions would be updated to
	 *
	 *     	   xtract.c     <xtract.c's version_info>
	 *     	   token.txt    <token.txt's version_info>
	 *     	   moduleB      <src/moduleB's version_info>
	 *
	 * info->offsets:
	 *
	 *     helps us track which entries in info->versions correspond to
	 *     which directories.  When we are N directories deep (e.g. 4
	 *     for src/modA/submod/subdir/), we have up to N+1 unprocessed
	 *     directories (+1 because of toplevel dir).  Corresponding to
	 *     the info->versions example above, after processing five entries
	 *     info->offsets will be:
	 *
	 *     	   ""           0
	 *     	   src/moduleB  2
	 *
	 *     which is used to know that xtract.c & token.txt are from the
	 *     toplevel dirctory, while umm.c & stuff.h & baz.c are from the
	 *     src/moduleB directory.  Again, following the example above,
	 *     once we need to process src/moduleB, then info->offsets is
	 *     updated to
	 *
	 *     	   ""           0
	 *     	   src          2
	 *
	 *     which says that moduleB (and only moduleB so far) is in the
	 *     src directory.
	 *
	 *     One unique thing to note about info->offsets here is that
	 *     "src" was not added to info->offsets until there was a path
	 *     (a file OR directory) immediately below src/ that got
	 *     processed.
	 *
	 * Since process_entry() just appends new entries to info->versions,
	 * write_completed_directory() only needs to do work if the next path
	 * is in a directory that is different than the last directory found
	 * in info->offsets.
