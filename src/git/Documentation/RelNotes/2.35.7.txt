Git v2.35.7 Release Notes
=========================

This release addresses CVE-2023-22490.


Fixes since v2.35.6
-------------------

 * CVE-2023-22490:

   Using a specially-crafted repository, Git can be tricked into using
   its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport.
   Though Git will abort local clones whose source $GIT_DIR/objects
   directory contains symbolic links (c.f., CVE-2022-39253), the objects
   directory itself may still be a symbolic link.

   These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known
   paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's
   working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as
   CVE-2022-39253.

 * A mismatched type in `attr.c::read_attr_from_index()` which could
   cause Git to errantly reject attributes on Windows and 32-bit Linux
   has been corrected.

Credit for finding CVE-2023-22490 goes to yvvdwf. The patches were
developed by Taylor Blau, with additional help from others on the Git
security mailing list.

Taylor Blau (3):
      t5619: demonstrate clone_local() with ambiguous transport
      clone: delay picking a transport until after get_repo_path()
      dir-iterator: prevent top-level symlinks without FOLLOW_SYMLINKS

Johannes Schindelin (1):
      attr: adjust a mismatched data type
