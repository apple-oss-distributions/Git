/**

/**
 * This describes the arguments, redirections, and environment of a

 * The caller:
 *
 * 1. allocates and clears (using child_process_init() or

 * 2. initializes the members;
 * 3. calls start_command();
 * 4. processes the data;
 * 5. closes file descriptors (if necessary; see below);
 * 6. calls finish_command().
 *
 * Special forms of redirection are available by setting these members
 * to 1:
 *
 *  .no_stdin, .no_stdout, .no_stderr: The respective channel is
 *		redirected to /dev/null.
 *
 *	.stdout_to_stderr: stdout of the child is redirected to its
 *		stderr. This happens after stderr is itself redirected.
 *		So stdout will follow stderr to wherever it is
 *		redirected.
